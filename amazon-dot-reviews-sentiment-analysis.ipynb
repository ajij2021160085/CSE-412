La calidad en los matices es excepcional; cada nota y cada instrumento se pueden diferenciar claramente, lo que permite apreciar la música.La facilidad con la que puedo conectar la bocina a Spotify y Apple Music es notable, y me permite disfrutar de mis listas de reproducción con la mayor comodidad mientras descanso en mi cuarto. El hecho de que funcione tan maravillosamente en solitario, sin la necesidad de un par estéreo, habla del poder y la eficiencia del diseño acústico de la bocina. Lamentablemente, Apple Music aún no es compatible con Lossless en la aplicación directamente, así que si quieres aprovechar este agregado, tendrás que transmitirlo por AirPlay (y tener muy buena conexión a internet).Aunque no me considero un audiófilo en el sentido más técnico (en bocinas, en audífonos es otra cosa), la calidad de sonido que emana de esta bocina me ha permitido disfrutar de mi música favorita decentemente (y para el público general, creo que será muy bueno). La facilidad de uso, la calidad de construcción y la calidad sonora hacen de esta bocina una pieza central en mi disfrute diario de la música en mi recámara principal. Definitivamente, es una adquisición que recomendaría a cualquiera que busque una experiencia auditiva sin las complicaciones de equipos más sofisticados.NOTA: Eso sí, si quieren una bocina mucho mejor en términos de calidad de audio, les recomendaría irse por la Sonos Five (actualmente, en el momento que estoy realizando esta reseña... quizá, en algún momento Sonos saque una Era 500, no lo sé).Gracias por leer mi reseña :)</td>\n      <td>Sonos Speaker</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3229</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>Reviewed in Mexico on February 10, 2024</td>\n      <td>La música se escucha impresionante, con buen espacio logra hacer efectos espaciales muy notorios, eso si, requiere de un servicio de música que tenga Dolby atmos o alguna otra versión de Dolby.

Sinceramente, al escuchar música atmos desde laapp de sonos - que es la forma de reproducir el audio espacial, al menos no sé de alguna otra eficaz  - no percibí realmente elsonido mágico que promete.

Es mi experiencia y ya lo tengo, no tengo interés en mentir.Llegó el segundo era 300.Lo incluí como par estéreo y descubrí que gandalf nunca se fue, incluso ya era el blanco. Aquí ya estamos en otro nivel de sonoridad. Opté por los dos tras mi sofá con sus pedestales de sonos y la música 🎶 mutó a un viaje dimensional de explosiones y texturas multicolores, pieles chinitas y demás sensaciones cósmicas.Con uno basta para una habitación de tamaño medio. Antes del segundo, llevé el primer era 300 a mi habitación, a la cocina, el baño 🛁 y pasó lo mismo: un gran sonido ambiental. No es intención del altavoz ser de notable fidelidad - dicen que eso caracteriza al sonos five -, pero sí que lo es, a mi juicio.El atmos mejora con el tiempo, recuerda.

Tengo una configuración de Beam 2nd gen + Sub + par de One SL y ahí sí es bastante notorio, aunque probablemente no sea una comparación justa.No obstante pienso que la Era 300 por sí sola es una muuuy buena opción, sobretodo si se busca algo \"futureproof\" considerando que mucha de la música nueva está siendo mezclada en audio espacial desde su producción.

I read many other reviews saying theirs had came in Spanish which would have been fine, but that was also not the case for me, mine was French.

I had to use a separate extension cable to be able to push the piece of furniture back against the wall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             it works fine but if you want to put this cord behind some furniture like me the plug will be sticking about 4 inches off the wall i had to use a separate extension cable to be able to push the piece of furniture back against the wall                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n7  Always wanted my house to be more techy and honestly this was a good first step for me. I have so many lights around the house and its so easy to control through voice rather than switching it off one by one every morning/night. My favorite command is “okay google, good morning”. It gives me a run down of my calendar, weather, important news, and plays my spotify to help me get ready!Listens to my voice even if I’m talking on a moderately low volume.The only thing i hate about it is that it took up the entire 2 sockets because its rather large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             always wanted my house to be more techy and honestly this was a good first step for me i have so many lights around the house and its so easy to control through voice rather than switching it off one by one every morningnight my favorite command is okay google good morning it gives me a run down of my calendar weather important news and plays my spotify to help me get readylistens to my voice even if im talking on a moderately low volumethe only thing i hate about it is that it took up the entire 2 sockets because its rather large\n8  Despite getting the Japanese language version for some reason, once paired it switched to English.
